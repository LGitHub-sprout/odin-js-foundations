This is a <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics">Foundations JavaScript Course</a> playground for The Odin Project.

This is a place to play and explore JavaScript as I read through tutorials and complete review exercises.

The Odin Project is a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online for front-end and full stack web development and programming.
